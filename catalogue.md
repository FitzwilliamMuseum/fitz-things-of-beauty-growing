For nearly a century British potters have invigorated traditional ceramic forms by developing or reinventing techniques, materials, and means of display.
Things of Beauty Growing explores major typologies of the vessel—such as bowl, vase, and charger—that have defined studio ceramics since the early 20th century.

It places British studio pottery within the context of objects from Europe, Japan, and Korea and presents essays by an international team of scholars and experts.

The book highlights the objects themselves, including new works by Adam Buick, Halima Cassell, and Nao Matsunaga, featured alongside works by William Staite Murray, Lucie Rie, Edmund de Waal, and others, many published here for the first time. Rounding out the beautifully illustrated volume is an interview with renowned collector John Driscoll and approximately fifty illustrated short biographies of significant makers.
