My previous experience in archaeological project management was gained during my time working for the ERC ADaPt project in Cambridge, and as Post Excavation Officer at Birmingham Archaeology, University of Birmingham. I have also worked as an Archaeologist at the Laboratory of Geoarchaeology, Almaty, Kazakhstan.

My PhD research explored the relationship between climate, subsistence strategies, and land use in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages in the Semirech'ye region of Kazakhstan through phytolith and faecal spherulite analysis. I am also interested in the political use of archaeology in modern day nation building in post-Soviet states.
